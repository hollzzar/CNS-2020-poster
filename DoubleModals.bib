	Abstract = {This articles investigates the rise of double modal constructions in Dutch. Double modal constructions combine two modal auxiliaries with one lexical verb (e.g. zal moeten gaan `shall have to go'). Little is known on why and how such complex verb constructions came into being. This article presents historical data for the earliest double modal constructions in Middle Dutch (13th century) drawing on both previous corpus studies and on new empirical observations. The historical data is then analyzed from a diachronic construction grammar perspective. The main theoretical point of this article is that the emergence of double modal constructions is a case of `constructional complexification', i.e. the process in which constructions become increasingly larger in size.},
	Annote = {This article investigates the historical development of double modal constructions in Dutch. The author notes that ``A defining formal feature of the construction is that the first modal is finite and the second embedded modal has the form of an infinitive. As such the construction differs from the well-studied double modal construction in some Southern American varieties of English, Northern British English and Scots, where two finite modals are combined'' (151). Because of this, the analysis in the paper is not directly applicable to my study; however, there is a discussion of construction grammar that is of interest (see Section 4).},

	Abstract = {Recent research has shown that distinct event-related potential (ERP) signatures are associated with switching between languages compared to switching between dialects or registers (e.g., Khamis-Dakwar and Froud, 2007; Moreno, Federmeier and Kutas, 2002). The current investigation builds on these findings to examine whether contrastive and noncontrastive morphosyntactic features in English elicit differing neural responses in bidialectal speakers of African American English (AAE) and Mainstream American English (MAE), compared to monodialectal speakers of MAE. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and behavioral responses (response types and reaction time) to grammaticality judgments targeting a contrasting morphosyntactic feature between MAE and AAE are presented as evidence of dual-language representation in bidialectal speakers. Results from 30 participants (15 monodialectal; 15 bidialectal) support the notion that bidialectal populations demonstrate distinct neurophysiological profiles from monolingual groups as indicated by a significantly greater P600 amplitude from 500ms-800ms time window in the monodialectal group, when listening to sentences containing contrasting features. Such evidence can support the development of linguistically informed educational curriculums and clinical approaches from speech-language pathologists, by elucidating the differing underlying processes of language between monodialectal and bidialectal speakers of American English.},
	Annote = {This dissertation investigated dialectal processing using ERPs. The main experiment compared the neural responses of bidialectal African American English (AAE) and mainstream English speakers to dialect-based syntactic variation. They found that mainstream English speakers exhibited a P600 effect when they heard a syntactic construction that is grammatical in AAE, while the AAE speakers processed sentences with those constructions the same way as the grammatical construction in mainstream English. Because double modals are also dialect-based syntactic variations, I would also expect a P600 in my study},

	Abstract = {In light of Mishoe and Montgomery's 1994 analysis of the double modal's pragmatic function in mitigating face-threatening situations this article assesses the perception of the double modal in the context of a medical consultation. In an experiment using a modified matched-guise technique and a between-subjects design, a group of respondents listened to a recording of a doctor using a naturally occurring double modal in consultation with a patient, while a control group heard the same recording with one of the modals removed. Attitudes of the respondents were measured indirectly though responses to a semantic differential test, and the ratings of the two groups were compared. While previous language attitude studies of nonprestige varieties show the usage of nonstandard features has a downgrading effect on the perception of a speaker's competence, this study found no downgrading effects. Instead, double modal guises were rated significantly higher for adjectives measuring solidarity, particularly the single adjective polite. That is, a doctor heard using a double modal was perceived as being more polite than the same doctor when the double modal was removed with no downgrading of the competence of the doctor, indicating that the double modal perceived -- at least in doctor-patient consultations -- as a good faith means to negotiate an imbalanced and face-threatening situation.},
	Annote = {Hasty 2015 used a matched-guise technique (MGT) to analyze the pragmatic function of double modal use in natural speech. Participants, who were SUSE speakers from Tennessee, listened to speech from a doctor-patient interaction and were asked to evaluate their bedside manner. The doctor used a double modal construction in some of the sentences, and Hasty found that the participants rated these doctors as more polite than the doctors who didn't use a double modal. The participants were not aware that the non-double modal sentences had the same doctor as the double modal sentence, with the second modal removed. This supports Mishoe and Montgomery's analysis of the pragmatic function of double modals; it also introduces an interesting comparison/critique of my sentence stimuli, where the single modal version of each double modal sentence uses the second modal rather than the first. Because I need to be able to compare the ERP signal to the same word across conditions, it's necessary for me to use the second modal, but I will need to address this in my introduction.},

@article{buhler2017,
	Annote = {B{\"u}hler et al. were interested in lexical and phonological variation in dialect. They were interested in dialects where both phonology and lexical items varied, and they were interested in comparing a dialect that ``corresponds more strongly to the German written norm'' to a dialect that was less standard (611). They also wanted to test children in order to determine the effect of exposure and ``the normative influences of learning the standard language variety at school'' on processing dialect (612). They looked at the PMN, N400, and LPC. There were three conditions: dialect-independent control, where the words are the same and are pronounced the same in the two dialects; vocabulary contrast, where the words are different in the two dialects; and pronunciation contrast, where the words are pronounced differently in the two dialects. Words in each condition were paired with pictures; some were congruent and others were incongruent. They predicted a congruency x language group interaction in the N400 time window for the vocabulary contrast condition (i.e. when an unfamiliar word is paired with either a congruent or incongruent image, the children should perceive a mismatch between the auditory and visual information), while they predicted this interaction in the PMN and LPC time windows for both the vocabulary and pronunciation contrast conditions (i.e. when an unfamiliar word in an unfamiliar dialect or a familiar word in an unfamiliar dialect, children should perceive a mismatch between the auditory and visual information). They performed two sets of statistical analyses: one that looked at all time epochs and electrodes for within-group (congruency) and between-group (language group) interactions, and another that looked at specific time epochs and electrodes related to the PMN, N400, and LPC. The PMN results did not reach significance, but they found the hypothesized interaction in the N400 time window for the vocabulary contrast condition and the hypothesized interaction in the LPC time window for both the vocabulary and pronunciation time windows.\\
Ultimately, the psycholinguistic study of dialect will be able to incorporate accent and many forms of structural variation (lexical and syntactic); for now, while we are still learning about language variation in the psycholinguistic space, it makes sense to isolate certain aspects. This study was very interesting because it was able to look at both accent and vocabulary. Since I'm studying a syntactic construction, and I've only seen one other paper using ERP to look at syntactic variation, I'm isolating the construction from accent (which is ecologically valid for double modals, but I need to be sure I make that clear by looking at more papers on the subject). In any case, this study combined sociolinguistic and ERP methods in a way that I hope to emulate.},

@article{goslin2012,
	Annote = {The introduction begins by setting up a dichotomy between the Perceptual Distance Hypothesis (e.g. Clarke and Garrett 2004) and the Different Processes Hypothesis (Adank et al., 2009; Chambers, 2002; Floccia et al., 2006, 2009; Girard, Floccia, and Goslin, 2008). Under the PDH, accents ``can be ranked on a perceptual scale according to their acoustic distance from native speech'' (92) such that processing of foreign accents is attenuated compared to that of familiar native accents, with the strength of processing of unfamiliar [regional] native accents in between. Under the DPH, foreign and unfamiliar native accents are processed functionally differently than familiar native accents. See Dupoux, Pallier, Sebastian, and Mehler, 1997 (French accented English and stress patterns and Wells 1982 (``coherent deviations in phonetic, phonological, phonotactic, and prosodic information'') for evidence for the DPH in foreign and unfamiliar native accented speech, respectively. The paper seeks to connect DPH to theories of spoken word recognition in which pre-lexical phonological mechanisms are ``tuned''/modulated by top-down input from lexical representations. The two hypotheses predict different strategies to accommodate to foreign accented speech (a question I have is; what happens with prolonged exposure to a particular type of foreign accented speech?). \\
The researchers presented auditory sentences in the participant's native accent, one of two native English accents, and one of two foreign English accents and time-locked to the final word in the sentence (94). They looked at the Phonological Mapping Negativity (PMN) and N400. For PMN, the PDH would predict increased amplitude in the PMN for both foreign accents and unfamiliar native accents, with the amplitude being higher for foreign than native (foreign {$>$} unfamiliar {$>$} familiar). The DPH would predict increased amplitude for unfamiliar native accents but reduced amplitude for foreign accents compared to familiar native accents (unfamiliar {$>$} familiar {$>$} foreign). For N400, they were less sure about what to predict based on the literature. For PDH, they predicted the same order as the PMN, but were unsure of direction of the difference in magnitude (foreign {$>$} unfamiliar {$>$} familiar or foreign {$<$} unfamiliar {$<$} familiar). For DPH, they predicted that unfamiliar and familiar accents would be the same, but that foreign would either have strengthened or attenuated amplitude comparatively (foreign {$>$} unfamiliar = familiar or foreign {$<$}  unfamiliar = familiar).\\
For PMN, they found unfamiliar {$>$} familiar {$>$} foreign (so unfamiliar was the most negative). For N400 they found unfamiliar = familiar {$>$} foreign (so unfamiliar and familiar were the most negative). They interpret their results in favor of DPH, especially with respect to the PMN results, and interpet the N400 results as normalization of the unfamiliar regional accent. While I'm not testing accent, this paper was an interesting exploration of dialectal variation. Their findings regarding the N400 and normalization of the unfamiliar regional accent are relevant for my paper; I will be interested to see if non-double modal speakers adapt to the double modal construction over the course of the experiment.},

@phdthesis{coleman1975,
	Annote = {Coleman collects data on double modals in SUSE using community observation, acceptability judgment questionnaires, direct questioning, and interviews. He uses the classification of modals from Huang 1969: can, could, may, might, will, would, shall, should, and ought to (67, 80 in the pdf). The most frequent MM combination (the presentation of the data does not make it clear whether this is from his community observation, direct questioning, or interview data) is might + another modal, which is consistent with the other papers with naturalistic speech data (e.g. Mishoe and Montgomery 1994) (84, 97 in the pdf). Coleman was able to elicit constructions where might/may was not the first modal, e.g. should might, but this was through his direct questioning method, so I am not sure that these would occur in natural speech (71, 85 in the pdf). In any case, the findings in this dissertation show support for using might could and might should in my stimuli, and also support my use of unlicensed reversed double modals (e.g. should could) for some of the filler sentences, since such forms are not grammatical for double modal speakers in any of the papers I've read.\\
Across the three regions he studied, Coleman found that might could was the most acceptable for active, present, non-progressive and that might should was the most acceptable for active, present perfect, non-progressive, but that this varied by region. He also found that ``the active, past, non-progressive environment is an important restriction on multiple modal patterns'' (83, 96 in the pdf), with only might could and might ought to appearing in this context in his dataset. It was also interesting to see that in the context of active, present perfect, non-progressive, have can move between might and another modal (e.g. might have could, which is often contracted to might've or might'a), but not between may and another modal. Might ought to was the most acceptable form in active present and present perfect progressive. He also found some acceptability for the reversed DMs should ought to and should might, as well as ought to should and ought to might, but that could might was accepted across all environments (106, 119 in the pdf). Overall, his data suggest an implicational array where might ought to and might could are the most pervasive patterns, followed by might should (see 121 for summary table, 134 in pdf). See 179 (pdf 192) for analysis of semantics of double modals (potentiality + mood).\\
This portion is not as relevant to my paper, but I'm just very interested in language change. Single modal constructions in English are ``present day reflexes of the inflected subjunctive mood in Old English'' (40, 53 in the pdf). He defines the subjunctive as: ``formal opposition shown by verb inflection or syntactic contrast indicating (1) the relationship(s) between one verb in the sentence and another verb structure expressing wish, command, desire, etc., and (2) that the speaker or writer is thinking in terms of non-fact or modification of fact, as distinct from fact (indicative mood) or command (imperative mood)'' (41). In present-day English, ``modal auxiliary constructions'' and ``modal preterite inflections'' are syntactic structures that have taken the place of the inflected subjunctive mood.},

@article{mishoe1994,
	Annote = {Mishoe and Montgomery analyze the pragmatic context of double modal use. The authors find two critical pragmatic features of DM contexts: one-on-one interactions between interlocutors and ``threat to the `face' (in the terms of Goffman 1967, etc.) of one or more speakers in a conversation'' (6). They argue that the pragmatic conditions of DMs are necessary for understanding their semantic and syntactic functions. For data, they collected 236 naturally occuring uses of DMs in South Carolina and neighboring areas of North Carolina, in addition to analyzing 488 tokens in interview data from the Linguistic Atlas of Gulf States (LAGS). The frequent combinations of DMs, somewhat strict order of the first and second modals, and limited (but not impossible) ability of DMs to appear in yes/no questions that Mishoe and Montgomery observed aligned with previous research on the subject (e.g. corpus data from Di Paolo 1986, Feagin 1979; elicitation data from Butters 1973, Coleman 1975, Boertien 1986). Might can, might could, and might would are the most commonly accepted DM combinations, with may/might usually appearing as the first modal. Questions are generally less acceptable than statements with DMs, but to the extent that they appear in spontaneous speech, the speakers in this sample uniformly fronted the second modal (11).\\
The authors take the perspective that DMs (and MMs more broadly) are ``a POTENTIAL set of constructions, governed by fairly loose constraints that `generate' (used in its broadest sense) certain combinations, sometimes unique ones, for MM users when particular circumstances warrant'' (8). In other words, Mishoe and Montgomery take the usage-based persepective that the pragmatic context governs the kinds of DM combinations that speakers actually produce. The authors argue that ``indirectness is the first key to understanding the pragmatics of modal combinations'' (13). The majority of the DM examples in their sample were ``associated with embedded structures'' and commonly appeared with first and second person subjects, which they took as ``syntactic evidence for indirectness'' (13). The authors also provided a brief diachronic overview of DMs which may be of interest (see 19-20).

	Abstract = {Native speakers of a language are often unable to consciously perceive, and have altered neural responses to, phonemic contrasts not present in their language. This study examined whether speakers of dialects of the same language with different phoneme inventories also show measurably different neural responses to contrasts not present in their dialect. Speakers with (n=11) and without (n=11) an American English I/E (pin/pen) vowel merger in speech production were asked to discriminate perceptually between minimal pairs of words that contrasted in the critical vowel merger and minimal pairs of control words while their event-related potential (ERPs) were recorded. Compared with unmerged dialect speakers, merged dialect speakers were less able to make behavioral discriminations and exhibited a reduced late positive ERP component (LPC) effect to incongruent merger vowel stimuli. These results indicate that between dialects of a single language, the behavioral response differences may reflect neural differences related to conscious phonological decision processes.

They used both behavior measures (whether the participants were able to discriminate the difference between the vowel pairs) and ERP measures, which included MMN, N400, and LPC. Behaviorally, speakers in the merged vowel group were less able to discriminate the vowel contrasts as the unmerged vowel group, but that the latter were less accurate than they would have expected (and less accurate than they were on the control words). Cognitively, the merged vowel group exhibited a greater LPC effect, which the researchers interpreted as a conscious decision-making process when they were answering the behavioral question. This study provides support for my over-arching hypothesis that speakers of a particular dialect differentially process aspects of that dialect differently than those who do not speak that dialect.},

	Abstract = {Previous analyses of the double modal construction in Southern United States English (SUSE) have been unable to fully explain all of the observed data regarding negation, questions, and stranded quantifiers. In this article, I argue for a structure placing the first modal in an MP merged above TP and the second modal in T. This structure has the benefits of maintaining the distinction seen between the two modals and explaining the separation of the modals by negation and stranded quantifiers while being able to explain the raising of the second modal in main clause questions. To support the proposed merged MP structure, I argue that the first modal of a double modal pair is immune to sequence of tense effects, and I take this as evidence that first position modals lack syntactic Tense. This is further supported with crosslinguistic evidence for epistemic modality located above Tense. This article thus explains SUSE double modals as an instance of parametric variation regarding the availability of epistemic modality to be located above Tense. I also address issues associated with the proposed structure involving the Head Movement Constraint and the proposed EPP feature on M.

	Annote = {Hasty provides a merged modal phrase analysis of double modals (DMs) in Southern United States English (SUSE) dialects. He reviews previous analyses that have attempted to account for DMs: adverbial analysis (Labov 1972), T (tense) analysis (Boertien 1986) (where both modals form the head of a T-bar), adjoined T-bar analysis (Battistella 1991, 1995) (where the second modal is the head of a T-bar and the first modal is joined above it to form a second T-bar), and single lexical item analysis (Di Paolo 1989) (which is similar to the T analysis in Boertien). His main evidence for rejecting these analyses comes from the behavior of DMs in both question contexts, where inversion of both modals or the second modal are acceptable depending on dialect but not the first modal, and negation contexts, where negation can appear either at the end or between the modals. He also considers triple modal constructions, which he reanalyzes as DMs, in his proposal for a merged MP analysis. He also argues that the first modal of a DM lacks syntactic tense but maintains morphological tense and that this modal's epistemic sense allows it to reside above the tense phrase (TP). This paper does a good job of explaining previous attempts to incorporate DMs into generative grammar. Overall, these papers (most of which I have read or plan to read) illustrate the difficulty of accounting for DMs in generative grammar and motivate further study of these constructions from a different angle.

@article{dipaolo1989,
	Annote = {Di Paolo analyzes double modal constructs (DMs) in the context of theoretical syntax. Adding rules to contemporary models of auxiliary verbs could not provide a full account of DM dialects of American English. She argues that single and double modals function similarly, such that DMs should be treated as ``two-word lexical items such as idioms or compounds'' (196). Before presenting judgment and production data from native speakers of a DM dialect, she presents two pieces of evidence regarding the similarity of single and double modals: first, that SM and DM dialects are mutually intelligible, and second, that DM dialects are easily acquired by speakers of SM dialects when moving into a DM speech community (196-197). Di Paolo collected data from 62 informants in Texas (Rusk and Dawson counties to represent East and West Texas, respectively) and supplemented these data with a corpus of 180 items. She looks at syntactic and semantic restrictions on DMs.\\
Regarding syntactic restrictions, she makes two general observations: first, that ``DM combinations are strictly ordered'' (198), so ``may can is acceptable but can may is not,'' and second, that may/might is often the first modal in the sequence. Regarding semantic restrictions, the most commonly accepted DMs with the first modal might are might could, might should, might oughta, and might would. Di Paolo presents evidence that might has a ``constant epistemic reading throughout and it contributes to the hedging, politely suggestive, and noninstrusive sense of DMs'' (198). The second modal changes the meaning of the DM, and thus changes its acceptibility. The most accepted meaning of might could was ability (rather than permission or possibility), while might should was more related to obligation or obligation/suggestion. Might would did not seem to be acceptable to most informants in this study, but in general the informations read this in a hypothetical sense. Di Paolo concludes this section by arguing that because different DM combinations behave differently (i.e. some have more of the epistemic might sense while others have more of the root modal sense), the analytical issue of DMs cannot be solved with a syntactic combination solution (if the meanings were syntactically driven, they would pattern the same way). Di Paolo then turns to the tense status of DMs, arguing that both modals in a DM construct are tensed (and thus are both finite). She then moves to her main argument, that DMs should be treated like ``multiword lexical items'' because they share the properties of ``nonproductivity, a combination of both unit-like and non-unit-like behavior, and syntactic and semantic irregularities'' (214). Using a lexical analysis to explain the behavior of DMs allows her to place DMs in the framework of generative grammar. These data align with the sources I've read to support the use of might could and might should in my experimental materials and to situation their use in particular pragmatic contexts. The experimental materials I am using present both a context and a critical sentence for each stimulus, allow the study to maintain some ecological validity in a lab setting.},
