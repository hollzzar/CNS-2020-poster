Psychonomics 2019 conference poster using posterdown

I am presenting this poster at the 60th Annual Meeting of the Psychonomic Society in Montréal, Québec, Canada. This work is part of my Master's thesis on language processing and dialectal variation in syntax.

In this repository, you will find:
- My R markdown file for the poster
- The HTML output from the markdown file
- The R script where I saved the commands to knit the HTML output into a PDF
- The final PDF of the poster
- My current bibliography for this research area
- Various logos/images, as well as the map that I saved as a PNG from a separate R script to format it correctly for the poster in the images folder
- Plot/graph outputs from the R markdown file in Psychonomics_files
- The HTML template from @posterdown that I customized to achieve some of the formatting in the poster (e.g., adjusting the size of the logos in the title box, creating a new section title box with a different color, decreasing the size of the reference section); if you want to use this template, you need to find where you have @posterdown downloaded and put this in the resources folder instead of the original template
