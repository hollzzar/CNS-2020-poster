# CNS 2020 poster
Cognitive Neuroscience 2020 conference poster using `posterdown_html`

I presented this poster at the [27th Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Neuroscience Society in Boston, Massachusetts](https://www.cogneurosociety.org/cns-2020-program/). This work will contribute to my Master's thesis on language processing and dialectal variation in syntax. 

I presented preliminary findings from my Mainstream American English participant group at Psychonomics in the fall. This poster includes the final Mainstream group, as well as an almost-complete Southern United States English (SUSE) participant group.

In this repository, you will find:
- The R Markdown file for the poster
- The HTML output from the markdown file
- The R script where I saved the commands to convert the HTML output into a PDF
- The final PDF of my poster
- My current bibliography for this research area
- Various logos/images; in the images folder, I also have the dialect exposure map from a separate R script
- Plot/graph outputs from the R markdown file in the CNS_2020_files folder
- The HTML template from `posterdown_html` that I customized to achieve some of the formatting in the poster (e.g., adjusting the size of the logos in the title box, creating a new section title box with a different color, decreasing the size of the reference section); if you want to use this template, you need to find where you have `posterdown_html` downloaded and put this in the resources folder instead of the original template
