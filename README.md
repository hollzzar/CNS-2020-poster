# Psychonomics 2019 poster
Psychonomics 2019 conference poster using `posterdown_html`

I presented this poster at the [60th Annual Meeting of the Psychonomic Society in Montréal, Québec, Canada](https://www.psychonomic.org/page/2019program). This work will contribute to my Master's thesis on language processing and dialectal variation in syntax.

In this repository, you will find:
- My R markdown file for the poster
- The HTML output from the markdown file
- The R script where I saved the commands to knit the HTML output into a PDF
- The final PDF of the poster
- My current bibliography for this research area
- Various logos/images; in the images folder, I also have the dialect exposure map from a separate R script (I saved it as a PNG instead of linking it directly to trim the white space added by R to maintain the aspect ratio)
- Plot/graph outputs from the R markdown file in the Psychonomics_files folder
- The HTML template from `posterdown_html` that I customized to achieve some of the formatting in the poster (e.g., adjusting the size of the logos in the title box, creating a new section title box with a different color, decreasing the size of the reference section); if you want to use this template, you need to find where you have `posterdown_html` downloaded and put this in the resources folder instead of the original template
