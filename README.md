Psychonomics 2019 conference poster using posterdown

I am presenting this poster at the 60th Annual Meeting of the Psychonomic Society in Montréal, Québec, Canada. This work is part of my Master's thesis on language processing and dialectal variation in syntax. I do not currently have the data for this poster on Github, so stay tuned! Otherwise, you can generally see the code I've used to create my tables and figures, particularly for the behavioral data. I have a separate script to create the ERP plots that I also hope to share here soon.
