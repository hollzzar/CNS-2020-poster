# Psychonomics 2019 poster
Psychonomics 2019 conference poster using `posterdown_html`

I presented this poster at the [60th Annual Meeting of the Psychonomic Society in Montréal, Québec, Canada](https://www.psychonomic.org/page/2019program). This work will contribute to my Master's thesis on language processing and dialectal variation in syntax.

In this repository, you will find:
- My R markdown file for the poster
- The HTML output from the markdown file
- The R script where I saved the commands to knit the HTML output into a PDF
- The final PDF of the poster
- My current bibliography for this research area
- Various logos/images; in the images folder, I also have the dialect exposure map from a separate R script (I saved it as a PNG instead of linking it directly to trim the white space added by R to maintain the aspect ratio)
- Plot/graph outputs from the R markdown file in the Psychonomics_files folder
- The HTML template from `posterdown_html` that I customized to achieve some of the formatting in the poster (e.g., adjusting the size of the logos in the title box, creating a new section title box with a different color, decreasing the size of the reference section); if you want to use this template, you need to find where you have `posterdown_html` downloaded and put this in the resources folder instead of the original template

I have included the abstract for my poster below.

*Many speakers of Southern United States English use a verb construction called a **double modal**, which comprises two consecutive auxiliary verbs. For example, the sentence “She said we **might could** go Tuesday” combines the modals **might** and **could**, which is not standard in Mainstream American English (MAE). While previous sociolinguistic research has studied syntactic variation across American English, very little psycholinguistic research has explored the relationship between intralingual diversity and language processing. The present study used Event-Related Potential (ERP) analysis to investigate online auditory comprehension of double modals versus single modals in MAE listeners. Results revealed that double modals elicited an early left-anterior negativity (ELAN) followed by a P600 effect, which suggests that unfamiliar dialectal variation in syntax engages both automatic detection of deviations from standard word-category rules and sentence-level syntactic reanalysis. These findings are interpreted in light of descriptive theories of language processing.*
